# Conflict of Interest Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to protect the integrity of The Community Arts Initiative (the "Organization") by establishing procedures to identify, disclose, and manage actual or potential conflicts of interest.

## Definition of Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest arises when a board member, officer, or senior staff member (a "Covered Person") has a personal, financial, or professional interest that could influence, or appear to influence, their judgment or actions in the performance of their duties to the Organization.

Examples include, but are not limited to:
* Direct or indirect financial interest in a transaction between the Organization and another entity.
* Receiving gifts, favors, or preferential treatment from any person or entity seeking to do business with the Organization.
* Using the Organization's property, information, or position for personal gain.
* Serving as a director, officer, or employee of a competing or contracting organization.

## Disclosure Procedure

1. Any Covered Person who becomes aware of a potential conflict of interest must promptly disclose it to the Board Chair (or, if the Board Chair is involved, to the Vice Chair).
2. Disclosures should be made in writing, describing the nature and extent of the interest.
3. All disclosures will be recorded in the minutes of the Board meeting at which they are presented.

## Annual Disclosures

In addition to the disclosure procedure outlined above, each Covered Person shall annually complete and sign a Conflict of Interest Disclosure Statement. The statement will be distributed by the Secretary of the Board and must be returned within thirty (30) days. The signed statements will be kept on file and reviewed by the Board Chair and Executive Director to ensure ongoing compliance.

## Handling of Identified Conflicts

When a conflict of interest is identified:
1. The Covered Person shall recuse themselves from any discussion and deliberation related to the matter.
2. The Covered Person shall not vote on the matter and shall not attempt to influence the decision.
3. The remaining disinterested board members shall decide whether the conflict is material and, if so, determine the appropriate course of action (e.g., approving the transaction with safeguards, prohibiting the transaction, or requiring the Covered Person to divest the conflicting interest).
4. The recusal and the decision of the disinterested members shall be documented in the minutes.
